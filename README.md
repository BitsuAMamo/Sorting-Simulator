# Sorting Algorithm graphical Simulator

## Description
### This is a simple python program built using the pygame module. It is used to visualy simultae different sorting algorithms.

### Usage
### Install all dependecies in the requirments.txt file.
### After that just run it as any python script. In this case **********python main.py******.
### To see the different algorithms just change the sorting algorithm name that is found in the `vis.viuslize()` call.

## Types of Algorithms
## Currently there are only two algorithms available.
### 1. Bubble sort -> `bullble_sort_visualize`
### 2. Quick sort -> `quick_sort`
> The quick sort need some fine tuning at the moment. To use it if you change the number of elements to sort  you need to manually cahnge the default value of the **high** parament to the number of elements - 1.
